      <h3 class="sports-history"> Track & Field</h3>
      <p>
        Some sporting feats ridicule expectations, fewer violate logic but the rarest of all added a defying of gravity to a
        hat-trick of achievements. At 3.45pm on 18 October 1968 in Mexico City’s Estadio Olímpico Universitario Bob Beamon
        accomplished all three.
      </p>
    
      <h3 class=sports-history> Rugby</h3>
      <p>
        With the game locked at 10 – 10 with thirty minutes on the clock, a Munster scrum just outside the Biarritz line
        enabled Peter Stringer to do the unexpected and break on the blindside for an unforgettable try. A moment of sheer
        brilliance by the Munster and Ireland scrumhalf. The try proved to be crucial as Munster won by 23 – 19 to lift the
        European Cup in Cardiff.
      </p>
      <h3 class=computing-history>The First Programmer</h3>
      <p>Ada Lovelace, whose real name was Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, and daughter to the poet Lord Byron, is widely
        considered to be the world’s first computer programmer, at least in the theoretical sense. As a young woman,
        Lovelace befriended the mathematician Charles Babbage who wrote plans for the Analytical Engine, a clockwork
        counting machine
      </p>
      <h3 class=computing-history>The First Compiler</h3>
      <p>
        Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (née Murray December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and
        United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of
        computer programming who invented one of the first linkers.
